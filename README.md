AI-Powered PDF Chatbot with Summarization and Contextual Q&A 📄🤖
Overview 🌟
This project is an AI-powered PDF chatbot that allows users to upload PDF documents and interact with them using natural language. Powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it extracts text, generates summaries (bullet-point, short, and detailed), and answers queries based on the document’s content. Additionally, a separate general-knowledge chatbot answers queries beyond the PDF, such as recent events (e.g., activities in India and Pakistan). Designed for academic research, legal document analysis, customer support, and general knowledge exploration.
Key Features 🔑

📤 PDF Upload: Supports uploading any PDF (e.g., textbooks, manuals, reports).
✍️ Text Extraction: Uses PyMuPDF for robust text extraction with error handling.
✂️ Text Chunking: Splits documents into manageable chunks (300–500 words) using LangChain.
🧬 Embeddings: Converts text into vectors using HuggingFace sentence transformers.
🔍 Vector Search: Stores embeddings in FAISS for fast and accurate similarity search.
📝 Summarization: Generates bullet-point, short, and detailed summaries using LLMs (e.g., BART, T5).
❓ Q&A Chatbot: Answers user queries with contextual responses using top-k retrieval.
🌍 General Knowledge Chatbot: A separate chatbot answers out-of-context questions, such as recent global events (e.g., activities in India and Pakistan).
📱 User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web-based frontend.

Tech Stack 🛠️

🐍 Python 3.10: Core programming language.
🔗 LangChain: For text splitting, embeddings, and prompt chaining.
🤗 HuggingFace Transformers: For summarization and Q&A (DistilBERT/BART/T5).
🔎 FAISS: Local vector search engine for efficient retrieval.
📚 PyMuPDF: PDF text extraction.
🌐 Flask/FastAPI: Backend API for handling requests.
📊 Streamlit: Frontend for user-friendly web interface.

Installation ⚙️
Prerequisites ✅

🐍 Python 3.10+
📦 pip package manager

Setup 🚀

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/saurabhpatle001/rag-pdf-app.git
cd rag-pdf-app


Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Install FAISS:
pip install faiss-cpu  # Use faiss-gpu for GPU support


Run the Streamlit frontend:
streamlit run app.py



Requirements 📋
Create a requirements.txt with:
langchain
transformers
sentence-transformers
pymupdf
faiss-cpu
flask  # or fastapi
streamlit

Usage 📖

Run the backend (if using Flask/FastAPI separately):
python backend.py

The API will be available at http://localhost:5000 (Flask) or http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI).

Run the Streamlit frontend:
streamlit run app.py

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:8501.

Upload a PDF:

Use the Streamlit interface to upload a PDF or the API endpoint /upload.


Interact with the chatbot:

📝 Summarize: Use the Streamlit interface or API endpoint /summarize?type=bullet|short|detailed.
❓ Query: Use the Streamlit interface or API endpoint /query?question=your_question_here.
🌍 General Knowledge: Ask questions unrelated to the PDF (e.g., "What’s happening in India and Pakistan?") via the Streamlit interface.



Example (API):
curl -X POST -F "file=@sample.pdf" http://localhost:5000/upload
curl http://localhost:5000/summarize?type=bullet
curl http://localhost:5000/query?question="What is the main topic of the document?"
curl http://localhost:5000/query?question="What’s happening in India and Pakistan?"

Performance 📈

✅ Accuracy: Over 95% on internal testing with academic PDFs.
✍️ Summarization: High coherence using BART or T5 models.
⚡ Processing Time: <3 seconds for documents under 50 pages.
📊 Scalability: FAISS ensures efficient retrieval for large documents.
🌍 General Knowledge: Provides detailed, context-aware answers for non-PDF queries.
